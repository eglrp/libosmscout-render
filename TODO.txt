* BUGS

* contour label style: text orientation flipped on certain ways, should be consistent

* contour label style: text doesn't show when doesn't fit on the available street space

* way geometry: way offsetting isn't perfect; inconsistencies are apparent when using
                outlined styles
                
* way geometry: way caps

* way geometry: some map way data is very poor (see ex: http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/36746525);
                we should check for this situation and resample the way
                its also possible that this can be done during import
                
* area geometry: area layering doesn't seem to work correctly
				 (ex: http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/6147259)
